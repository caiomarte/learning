/* LEADERBOARD
* You are given a program that should output the even ranks of a leaderboard.
* However, somebody added and removed comments in the code, breaking that logic.
* Fix the code by commenting and uncommenting the corresponding lines to generate the desired output.
*
* ! The resulting program should output only the even ranks of the leaderboard.
