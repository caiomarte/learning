### if/else
*Source: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1164/4861/12487/1*

---
- The **`if` statement** can be used to make decisions and run code when a given condition is `true`.
- The code of the `if` statement should be enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- The **`else` statement** can be sed to run code when the condition of an `if` statement is `false`.
- There is *no* **ternary if** in Go, so a full `if` statement is always required.
- The `if` statement can start with a **variable declaration** before the condition.
```go
if x := 42; x > 18 {
    fmt.Println("Allowed")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Not allowed")
}
```

- **Semicolon** `;` is used to separate statements.
- Variables declared in a `if` statement are only available within the `if/else` block.
