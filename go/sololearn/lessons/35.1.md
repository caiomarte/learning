### Maps

---
- **Maps** are used to store **key:value** pairs.
- The key is always unique.
- Maps can be created using the **`make()`** function, similar to arrays.
- In the code below, `m` is a `map` that maps a `string` key to an `integer` value.
```go
m := make(map[string]int)

m["James"] = 42
m["Amy"] = 24

fmt.Println(m["James"])     // 42
```

- Maps can also be initialized using the following syntax:
```go
m := map[string]int {
    "James": 42,
    "Amy": 24
}

fmt.Println(m["Amy"])       // 24
```

- If the requested key does not exist in the map, a zero value will be returned.
- Maps are also called dictionaries, associative arrays, or hash tables.
- The **`delete()`** function is used to remove an element from the map.
```go
delete(m, "James")
```

- New elements are created by simply assigning a key to a new value.
```go
m["Bob"] = 8
```

- Maps are printed in the form **`map[key:value key:value]`** when output with **`fmt.Println()`**.
```go
fmt.Println(m)              // map[Amy:24 Bob:8]
