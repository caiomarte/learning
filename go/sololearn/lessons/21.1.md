### Defer
*Source: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1164/4870/12506/1*

---
- A **`defer` statement** ensures that the function is called only after the surrounding function returns.
- For example, the code bellow will first output `Hey` and only after that output the result of the `welcome()` function. This happens because the call to `welcome()` is deferred, meaning it waits until `main()` finishes execution and only then calls it.
```go
func welcome() {
    fmt.Println("Welcome")
}

func main() {
    defer welcome()
    fmt.Println("Hey")
}
```

- `defer` is often used to cleanup, for example, to release resources used by the code, such as files, connections, etc.
- `defer` calls are **stacked** on top of each other, which means multiple deferred function calls are executed in **last-in-first-out order**.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Print("start")
    defer fmt.Print(" end")
    
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        defer fmt.Print(i)
        defer fmt.Print(" ")
    }
}

// start 4 3 2 1 0 end
```
