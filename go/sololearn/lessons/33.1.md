### Slices

- An array has a fixed size, meaning once defined, the number of elements it holds cannot be changed.
- To overcome this, Go provides the **slice**, which is a dynamically-sized view into the elements of an array.
- A slice is based on an array and is defined by specifying two indices, a **low** and **high** bound, separated by a colon.
- The elements of a slice include the first given index, but exclude the last.
```go
a := [5]int{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
var s []int = a[1:3]

fmt.Println(s)          // [2 4]
```

- The low and high bound can be omitted.
  - Omitting the low bound will take the value 0.
  ```go
  fmt.Println(a[:3])    // [0 2 4]
  ```
  - Omitting the high bound will take the length of the array.
  ```go
  fmt.Println(a[1:])    // [2 4 6 8]

- The values of the slice are accessed using the same syntax as with arrays.
```go
a := [5]int{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
var s []int = a[1:3]

fmt.Println(s[1])       // 4
```

- A slice does not store any data; it just describes a section of an underlying array. Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array.
```go
s[0] = 8
fmt.Println(a)          // [0 8 4 6 8]
```

- It's possible to have multiple slices of the same array. A change in any of them will be seen in all slices, as it will affect the underlying array.

- Go provides a **`make()`** function to create slices. This is the way to create **dynamically-siced arrays**.
```go
a := make([]int, 5)
```

- The **`make()`** function creates an array of the given type and size, and returns a slice that refers to that array.
- After creating a slice, it's possible to append new elements to it using the **`append()`** function.
```go
a := make([]int, 5)
a = append(a, 8)
fmt.Println(a)          // [0 0 0 0 0 8]
```

- The **`append()`** function takes the slice as its first argument and the elements to be added to the end of the slice as its next argument. It then returns a new slice, containing the old slice plus the new elements appended.
- It's possible to append multiple values at once by just comma separating the values as arguments.
```go
append(s, 1, 2, 3)
```
