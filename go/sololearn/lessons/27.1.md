### Structs
*Source: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1164/4875/12517/1*

---
- Go does not support **classes**. Instead, it has **structs**.
- **Structs** are collections of fields that allow you to group data together.
```go
type Contact struct {
    name string
    age int
}
```

- Structs are initialized using the `StructType{$comma_separated_values}` syntax.
```go
x := Contact{"James", 42}
```

- It's also possible to provide the name of the fields for code readability.
```go
x := Contact{name: "James", age: 42}
```

- Struct fields are accessed (or changed) using the `structName.structField` syntax.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Contact struct {
    name string
    age int
}

func main() {
    x := Contact{
        name: "James",
        age: 42
    }

    x.age = 8
    
    fmt.Println(x.age)      // 8
    fmt.Println(x.name)     // James
}
