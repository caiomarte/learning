#### Relational Operators
- **Relational operators** are used to compare two values and return a **bool** as the result: `true` when the comparison condition holds, and `false` when it does not.
    - `==` - equal to
    - `!=` - not equal to
    - `>` - greater than
    - `<` - less than
    - `>=` - greater or equal to
    - `<=` - less or equal to

#### Logical Operators
- **Logical Operators** are used to combine two or more conditions.
    - `&&`, **AND** - returns `true` when both conditions are true
    - `||`, **OR** - returns `true` when at least one of the conditions is true
    - `!`, **NOT** - returns `true` when the condition is false, basically reversing the result of the condition
- Multiple conditions can be combined together and grouped inside parentheses.
