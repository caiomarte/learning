### Select
*Source: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1164/4889*

---
- The **`select`** statement is used to wait on multiple channel operations.
- The syntax is similar to `switch` except that each of the case statements will be a channel operation.
- Using the previous example, `select` is used to select the channel that is ready first.
```go
evenCh := make(chan int)
sqCh := make(chan int)

go evenSum(0, 100, evenCh)
go squareSum(0, 100, sqCh)

select {
    case x := <- evenCh:
        fmt.Println(x)
    case y := <- sqCh:
        fmt.Println(y)
}
```

- The **`select`** statement waits for a channel to receive data and executes its **`case`**.
- This means that only one of the cases will execute -- the one that corresponds to the channel that receives data first.
- If both channels receive data at the same time, one of the cases is chosen randomly.
- A **`select`** can have a **`default`** case, which will execute when no channel is ready.
- For example, there could be an infinite `for` loop, waiting for one of the channels to receive data.
- The `for` loop uses a `select` to check which channel got data. If none of them are ready, the `default` case will execute which will wait for 50 ms. As soon as a channel gets data, the `return` statement will exit the loop.
```go
for {
    select {
        case x := <- evenCh:
            fmt.Println(x)
            return
        case y := <- sqCh:
            fmt.Println(y)
            return
        default:
            fmt.Println("Nothing avaliable")
            time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}
```

- A **`select`** statement blocks until at least one of its cases can proceed. The `default` case is useful in preventing **deadlocks** -- without it the `select` would wait for a channel forever, crashing the program if none of the channels received data.
