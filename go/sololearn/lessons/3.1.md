*Source: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1164/4854/12465/1*

---
- Packages have exported names that can be accessed after importing.
- In Go, exported names begin with a **capital letter**.
- You can access the exported name using the package name, a dot, and the exported name.
```go
fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
``` 

- `func main()` is the program entry point. It's the function that gets executed when the program is run.
