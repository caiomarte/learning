### Variadic Functions

- **Variadic functions** are functions that can be called with any number of arguments.
- For example, the **`fmt.Println()`** is a common variadic function. It can be provided any number of comma-separated arguments, and it will output them separated by spaces.
```go
fmt.Println("a", "b", "c")      // a b c
```

- It is also possible to define variadic functions from scratch.
- For example, the variadic function belows calculates and outputs the sum of its arguments:
```go
func sum(nums ...int) {
    total := 0
    for _, v := range nums {
        total += v
    }
    fmt.Println(total)
}

func main() {
    sum(2, 4, 6)                // 12
    sum(42, 8)                  // 50
    sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)       // 21
}
```

- The 3 dots `...` before the argument type defines it as variadic.
- The syntax below uses the multiple values in a slice as arguments for a variadic function.
```go
s := []int{42, 33, 22, 11}
sum(s...)                       // 108
```

- Without the 3 trailing dots, the argument will result in a single slice instead of multiple values, causing an error.
