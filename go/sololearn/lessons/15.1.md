### Loops

- **Loops** are used to repeat code until a certain condition holds.
- **`for`** is the *only* loop construct in Go.
- In Go, a `for` loop has three components: **init; condition; post statement**.
```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

- `i++` is a shorter version of `i = i + 1` and is called the **increment operator**.
- The **init** and **post** statements can be *omitted*, in which case `for` becomes similar to **while** loops available in other programming languages.
```go
sum := 1
res := 0
for sum <= 1000 {
    res += sum
    sum++
}
```
