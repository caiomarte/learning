### Pointers

---
- All values defined within a program are stored in the cmputer memory and have their own unique memory address.
- **Pointers** are special variables that hold the memory address of values.
- In Go, pointers are declared using a `*` followed by the type of the value that will be stored in the memory address the pointer will be assigned to.
```go
var p *int
```

- The **`&` operator** returns the memory address of a variable, and it's used to assign a memory address to a pointer.
```go
x := 42
p := &x
fmt.Println(p)      // 0xc000016070
```

- The **`*` operator** is used to access the underlying value of the pointer.
```go
x := 42
p := &x
fmt.Println(*p)      // 42
```

- The **`*` operator** can also be used to change the value of the memory address the pointer holds.
```go
x := 42
p := &x

*p = 8

fmt.Println(*p)      // 8
fmt.Println(x)       // 8
```

- The `*` operator is called the **dereferencing** operator.
