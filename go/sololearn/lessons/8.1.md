### Data Types

- Common variable types Go supports:
    - `float32` - single-precision floating point values
    - `float64` - double-precision floating point values
    - `string` - text values
    - `bool` - boolean values, `true` or `false`.
- The difference between `{type}32` and `{type}64` is memory space and precision, in the case of numeric types.
- Variables that are declared without a value take the zero value of their type:
    - `0` for numeric types
    - `false` for boolean type
    - `""` for strings
