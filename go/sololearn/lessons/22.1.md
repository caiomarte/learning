### Scope

---
- Scope is where a variable can be used.
- There are two main scopes in Go: **local** and **global**.
- A variable defined in the function is called a **local** variable. Their scope is only in the function body, which means they only exist within their function.
- Arguments are also local variables for that function.
```go
func test() {
    var x = 8
    fmt.Println(x)      // 8
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(x)      // error: undefined x
}
```

- A variable defined outsite the local scope is called a **global** variable. Global variables can be used throughout the package.
- Global variables are often considered a bad practice. It is better to pass variables as function arguments.
```go
var x = 8

func test() {
    fmt.Println(x)      // 8
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(x)      // 8
}
```
