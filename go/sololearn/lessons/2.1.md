- Every Go program is made up of **packages**.
- A Go program starts running in the `main` package.
- Go has many packages that can be imported and used in the code to accomplish different tasks.
- `fmt` stands for **format** and provides input and output functionality.
- You can import one or multiple packages using the `import` statement.
    - *Single import*
    ```go
    import "fmt"
    ```

    - *Multiple import*
    ```go
    import (
        "fmt"
        "math"
    )
