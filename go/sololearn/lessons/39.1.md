- **Concurrency** means multiple computations are happening at the same time. It is used when a program has multiple things to do.
- Concurrency is about creating multiple processes executing independently.
-  In order to use concurrency, the program is broken into parts, which are then executed separately.
- Concurrency is used to achieve the intended results in less time, thus increasing the overall performance and efficiency of programs.
- To achieve concurrency, Go provides **Goroutines**.
- A **Goroutine** is muck like a thread to accomplish multiple tasks, but it consumes fewer resources than OS threads.
- When a program is broken down into separate tasks, each Goroutine can be used to accomplish a task, enabling concurrency in a program.
- **Goroutines** are *not* OS threads: they are virtual threads; managed by Go. It's possible to have thousands of Goroutines running in a Go program.
