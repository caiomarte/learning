### Arrays
*Source: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1164/4879/12532/1*

---
- **Array** is a sequence of elements of the same type.
- Arrays have a **fixed size** that must be provided upon declaration.
- Arrays are defined using square brackets `[]` with the number of elements the array will hold.
```go
var a [5]int
```

- **Arrays** can also be initialized during creation.
```go
a := [5]int{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
```

- After declaring an array, its elements can be accessed by using square brackets `[]` and their **indexes**.
```go
var a [5]int

a[0] = 8
a[1] = 42

fmt.Println(a[1])       // 42
```

- Each element of an array has its unique index, starting with `0`.
- The first element has the index `0` and the last element has the index `$size-1`, which is the whole number before the size of the array.
```go
a := [5]int{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}

fmt.Println(a[0])       // 0
fmt.Println(a[4])       // 8
```
