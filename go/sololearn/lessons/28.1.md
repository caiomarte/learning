### Pointers to Structs
*Source: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1164/4876/12522/1*

---
- Similar to simple pointers, pointers to structs are created using the `&` operator.
```go
x := Contact{"James", 42}
p := &x
```

- Pointers to structs are automatically dereferenced, so field values are accessible using a dot.
```go
fmt.Println(p.age)      // 42
```

- `(*p).age` is also a valid expression to access the age field, which is the longer version of `p.age`.  
```go
fmt.Println((*p).age)   // 42
```

- Pointers can also be used when creating a new struct.
```go
p := &Contact{"John", 15}
```

- Pointers structs are useful when passing structs as function arguments.
