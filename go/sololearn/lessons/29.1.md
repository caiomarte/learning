### Methods

- **Structs** can have functionality using **methods**.
- **Methods** are functions with a special **receiver argument**.
- The **receiver** appears between the **func** keyword and the method name.
- The receiver structs fields can be accessed in the method.
```go
func (x Contact) welcome() {
    fmt.Println(x.name)
    fmt.Println(x.age)
}
```

- After defining the method, it can be called on the struct using the dot syntax.
```go
x := Contact{"James", 42}
x.welcome()             // James
                        // 42
```

- Since methods are just functions with a receiver argument, the same functionality is provided by using a regular function that takes a struct as its argument.
```go
func welcome(x Contact) {
    fmt.Println(x.name)
    fmt.Println(x.age)
}

func main() {
    x := Contact{"James", 42}
    welcome(x)          // James
                        // 42
}
```

- To change the data of the struct in a method, **pointers** can be used as method **receivers**.
```go
func (ptr *Contact) increase(val int) {
    ptr.age += val
}

func main() {
    x := Contact{"James", 42}
    x.increase(8)
    fmt.Println(x.age)  // 50
}
```

- Go automatically dereferences the pointers, so the method can simply be called by the struct name.
- Since methods often need to modify their receiver, pointer receivers are more common than value receivers.
