### Variables
*Source: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1164/4857/12474/1*

---
- To declare a variable, use the `var` keyword.
- You must also state what's the variable type.
```go
var i int
```

- `int` stands for **integers** and represents whole numbers.
- It's possible to initializa a variable along declaration.
```go
var i int = 8
```

- It's also possible to declare and initialize multiple variables on a single line.
```go
var i, j int = 8, 42
```

- Go automatically infers variable type based on the assigned value.
```go
var i, j = 8, 42
```

- Go also supports short variable declaration using `:=`.
```go
i := 8
```

```go
x, y := 10, 5
```
