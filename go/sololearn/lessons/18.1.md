- **Functions** allow for defining a block of code, giving it a name, and calling it multiple times within the program.
- A function is called by its **name** followed by **parentheses**.
- Go packages provide exported functions, e.g. `fmt.Println()`.
- Functions can be defined using the **`func` keyword**.
- The code block of the function needs to be enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
