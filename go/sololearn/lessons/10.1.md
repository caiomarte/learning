- Go supports all common arithmetic operators:
    - `+` - Addition
    - `-` - Subtraction
    - `*` - Multiplication
    - `/` - Division
    - `%` - Modulus, results in the remainder of the division
  
- `+` can also be used to concatenate strings.
```go
x := "hello "
y := "world"
fmt.Println(x + y)  //hello world
```

- Go supports short assignment operators to replace statements such as `x = x + y` with `x += y`.
