### Range

- The **range** form of the **for** loop allows for iterating over a slice.
```go
a := make([]int, 5)
a[1] = 2
a[2] = 3

for i, v := range a {
    fmt.Println(i, v)
}

/* (i v)
 *  0 0
 *  1 2
 *  2 3
 *  3 0
 *  4 0
 */
```

- During each iteration of the loop, it returns two values: the index of the element and its value.
- The index can be skipped using an underscore.
```go
for _, v := range a {
    fmt.Println(v)
}
/* 0
 * 2
 * 3
 * 0
 * 0
 */
```

- Ranges can be used for slices as well as arrays.
- The range can also be used to iterate over the characters of a string.
```go
x := "hello"
for _, c := range x {
    fmt.Println(c)
}
/* 104
 * 101
 * 108
 * 108
 * 111
 */
```

- The program above outputs **Unicode code points** of the characters. To output the actual characters, the **`Printf()`** function is required.
```go
for _, c := range x {
    fmt.Printf("%c \n", c)
}
/* h
 * e
 * l
 * l
 * o
 */
```

- The **`Printf()`** function is similar to the one in C, taking the format of the output as its argument. **`%c`** denotes a character, while **`\n`** defines a new line.
